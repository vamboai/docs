## Standardization

We use the [ISO 639-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-3) standard to classify languages.
This standard is extremely extensive and meant to cover all known languages.
In the case of Swahili for example, the ISO 639-1 code is `sw` and the ISO 639-2 code is `swa`.
The ISO 639-3 standard allows for a more detailed classification of Swahili, using `swc` for Congo Swahili and `swh` for Coastal Swahili.

## Languages not covered by ISO 639-3

We do not currently cover any languages that are not covered by ISO 639-3.
Should this change in the future, we will maintain existing languages codes so as not to break existing API integrations.
